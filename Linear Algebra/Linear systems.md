A linear system of equations is a collection of equations with the same number of unknowns. 

Linear refers to the fact that unknown parameters are only a scalar multiple. There are no functions. 

They can be written out 3 ways:
- As a system 
- As a matrix 
- As a vector

Linear systems are solved with [[Gaussian elimination]]

A common form of linear system that linear algebra solves is:
$$
Ax = b â†’ x = A^{-1}b
$$
