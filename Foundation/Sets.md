A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects

If $S$ is a set & $P$ is a property of elements in $S$, then:
$$
\{x \in S:P(x)\}
$$
	is the set of all elements of $S$ that have property $P$

Some important sets are:
- $\{ \}$ / $\phi$: empty set
- $\mathbb{N}$: natural integers
- $\mathbb{Z}$: integers
- $\mathbb{R}$: real numbers

Set elements & operations:
- $x \in B$ → $x$ belongs to / is an element of $B$
- $A \subseteq B$ → all of $A$ also lies in $B$; a subset
	- A strict subset ($\subset$) must have fewer elements by definition
- $A \cap B$ → intersection
- $A \cup B$ → union
- $A \backslash B$ → difference
